#fnstyle

This is Symfony example of clothing shop. The project works fine, but requires fixes and more features:

WORKING:

1. Admin page with products, stock management.
2. Simple admin's control over users.
3. New product features can be easily added/removed.
4. Search input, filtering, price narrowing, etc.
4. Website written with Symfony, PHP, JS and Boostrap.
5. Fully responsive.

TODO:

1. Better LocalStorage/Symfony Session synchronization (when the website is launched and some data are kept in LocalStorage they are not in Session at first)
2. No sales management module yet.
3. No payment module implemented.
4. Could have more control over website content.
5. Error handling must be vastly improved.
6. Some issues with displaying on iOS devices (admin->settings->shift input)
